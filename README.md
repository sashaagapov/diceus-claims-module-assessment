# DICEUS Claims Module Assessment

This repository contains a planned backend-first MVP for a simplified Claims Management System in the insurance domain.

The project is intentionally prepared in phases. This first phase does not implement application code yet. It creates repository context, scope, planning documents, and rules for controlled AI-assisted development.

## Project Idea

The system will model a simplified claim lifecycle:

- A user creates a claim after a loss event.
- The first claim creation process is called FNOL, or First Notice of Loss.
- A claim can be linked to a simulated insurance policy.
- A claim contains loss details, claimant parties, risk objects, status, reserves, and audit log records.
- A reserve represents an expected financial cost of the claim.
- Small reserves are auto-approved.
- Larger reserves require supervisor or manager approval.
- A user must not approve their own reserve.
- Approved reserves trigger a Hangfire background job that simulates GL posting and writes an audit log entry.

## MVP Direction

This is a backend-first MVP. The first demo path should work through Swagger/OpenAPI before any frontend is added.

The backend is the main assessment focus because it shows:

- domain modeling
- API design
- validation
- persistence
- business rules
- background processing
- auditability
- explainable architecture

## Planned Stack

- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Clean Architecture
- EF Core
- SQL Server
- Docker-based SQL Server for local reproducibility
- MediatR
- FluentValidation
- Swagger/OpenAPI
- Hangfire
- Optional Angular frontend after the backend core is stable

## Planned Demo Path

1. Start the API.
2. Open Swagger.
3. Search seeded policies.
4. Create a claim through FNOL.
5. View claim details.
6. View audit log entries.
7. Transition claim status.
8. Create a reserve under 10,000 and show auto-approval.
9. Create a reserve over 10,000 and show pending approval.
10. Try self-approval and show the validation error.
11. Approve the reserve as supervisor or manager.
12. Show the Hangfire GL posting audit entry.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project is AI-assisted, but AI should be used as an engineering partner, not as an uncontrolled code generator.

Future AI work should:

- read the planning documents before coding
- implement small vertical slices
- keep the code explainable for a beginner-level .NET developer
- document decisions and tradeoffs
- avoid overbuilding
- run build/tests when possible

See `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md` for the working rules.

## Current Status

Phase 1 backend scaffold is completed.

The repository now contains a .NET 9 Clean Architecture solution with separate Domain, Application, Persistence, Infrastructure, and API projects. The API currently exposes only a simple `/health` endpoint and Swagger in development.

Claim logic, reserve logic, EF entities, migrations, authentication, and frontend code have intentionally not been implemented yet.
