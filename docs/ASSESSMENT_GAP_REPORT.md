# Assessment Gap Report

**Phase:** 9A — Full Assessment Gap Audit  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Author:** AI-assisted audit (Antigravity)  
**Repo state:** commit `50fb691` — `fix: use CLM-{YYYY}-{7-digit-sequence} claim number format`  
**Branch:** `main` — clean working tree

---

## Current Status Summary

The repository contains a complete backend-first MVP with a working Angular frontend
that covers the full core claim and reserve workflow. The backend is the strongest part
of the submission. The Angular frontend adds a usable local demo surface.

**All build and test gates pass:**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `dotnet restore` | ✅ all up-to-date |
| `dotnet build --no-restore` | ✅ 0 warnings, 0 errors |
| `dotnet test` (5 integration tests) | ✅ 5/5 passed |
| `npm install` | ✅ |
| `npm run build` | ✅ succeeded (bundle budget warning only) |
| `npm test -- --watch=false` (2 tests) | ✅ 2/2 passed |

**Estimated overall completion against full DICEUS assessment: ~75–80%**

The missing items (document upload, SLA job, Azure deployment, CI/CD, real auth)
are documented as intentional tradeoffs, not oversights.

## Overall Completion Estimate

| Category | Weight | Completion |
|---|---|---|
| Backend architecture + persistence | High | ~95% |
| FNOL + claim lifecycle | High | ~90% |
| Reserve workflow + approval | High | ~100% |
| Hangfire GL posting | High | ~100% |
| Audit logging | High | ~95% |
| Frontend screens | Medium | ~85% |
| Mock users / auth | Medium | ~90% |
| Testing | Medium | ~55% |
| Documentation | Medium | ~90% |
| Document upload | Low | 0% |
| SLA monitoring job | Low | 0% |
| Azure deployment | Low | 0% |
| CI/CD | Low | 0% |

**Weighted overall estimate: ~75–80%**

The 20–25% gap is almost entirely in features documented as intentionally out of scope
for a backend-first MVP. The core assessment value areas (architecture, business rules,
persistence, audit, background jobs) are at 90–100%.

## Prioritized Next Phases

### Priority 1 — Minimum Recommended Before Submission

| Phase | Item | Effort | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9B | Update `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` with Angular frontend walk-through | Low | None |
| 9B | Add live review talking-point notes | Low | None |
| 9B | Add server-side filtering to `GET /api/claims` | Medium | Low |
| 9B | Fix Angular bundle budget warning | Low | Low |

### Priority 2 — Optional Quality Improvements

| Phase | Item | Effort | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9C | Add basic SLA Hangfire recurring job (if spec requires it) | Medium | Low |
| 9C | Expand frontend component tests | Medium | Low |
| 9C | Add GitHub Actions CI workflow (build + test only, no deploy) | Low | Low |
| 9C | Add `Dockerfile` for API (shows awareness, not deployed) | Low | Low |

### Priority 3 — Out of Scope (Do Not Build Unless Explicitly Required)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Real Azure deployment | High effort, not critical for assessment value |
| Real authentication (JWT/Identity) | High effort, high risk of breaking existing test setup |
| Document upload | High effort, no backend infrastructure prepared |
| Full E2E tests | Needs browser automation tooling (blocked on macOS) |
| NgRx | Explicitly out of scope in MVP_SCOPE.md |

---

## Recommended Submission Strategy

### Option A — Submit Now (Recommended if deadline is close)

The current state demonstrates:

- Clean Architecture correctly implemented and explainable
- All core business rules working and tested
- MediatR + FluentValidation pipeline
- EF Core with proper migrations and seed data
- Reserve approval with threshold, role checks, self-approval prevention
- Hangfire GL posting with idempotency
- Append-only audit log
- Working Angular frontend with all core screens
- Automated integration tests covering the full backend MVP flow
- Complete documentation of scope, tradeoffs, and AI-assisted workflow

**How to frame the gaps during review:**

> "Document upload, Azure deployment, CI/CD, and SLA monitoring were deliberately scoped
> out of the MVP to ensure the core backend flow is complete, correct, tested, and
> explainable. These are documented in `docs/TRADEOFFS.md`. The backend-first approach
> was chosen because the assessment value is in architecture clarity and business-rule
> implementation, not infrastructure configuration."

### Option B — One More Phase Then Submit (Recommended if 2–4 hours available)

Complete Phase 9B (demo polish + server-side filtering) before submission:

1. Update `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` with Angular frontend walk-through and talking points.
2. Optionally add query-parameter filtering to `GET /api/claims`.
3. Commit and push.

## Risks If Submitted Now

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Reviewer expects document upload | Medium | Documented as explicit tradeoff |
| Reviewer expects SLA job | Medium | Documented as out-of-scope; needs clarification |
| Reviewer expects Azure deployment | Low–Medium | Documented; local Docker + README demo path provided |
| Reviewer expects CI/CD | Low | Documented; manual commands in README |
| Frontend component tests are thin | Low | Integration tests cover all business flows |
| Angular bundle budget warning | Very Low | Build succeeds; warning is cosmetic |
| Node 25 / Angular 21 version warning | Very Low | Documented in TRADEOFFS.md |

---

## Risks If Overbuilding

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Adding real auth breaks existing test setup | High | Mock user pattern is deeply integrated |
| Adding Azure deployment introduces credentials risk | High | AGENTS.md explicitly prohibits committing secrets |
| Adding CI/CD may introduce secrets exposure | Medium | Needs careful secrets management |
| Adding NgRx increases complexity without assessment value | Medium | Explicitly out of scope |
| Adding E2E tests on macOS requires browser tooling | Medium | Browser automation blocked on macOS |

---

## Most Important Missing Items (Decision Required)

1. **SLA monitoring job** — Needs clarification: is a basic recurring Hangfire SLA
   check explicitly required by the DICEUS spec? If yes, Phase 9C should add it.
   If not, the current out-of-scope documentation is sufficient.

2. **Server-side claim list filtering** — The current `GET /api/claims` returns all
   claims with no query parameters. If the assessment expects a filterable API, this
   is a small backend addition with low risk (Phase 9B candidate).

3. **Live review talking-point notes** — `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` covers the Swagger path well
   but lacks explicit Angular frontend walk-through notes. Low effort, high value for
   a live demo (Phase 9B candidate).

4. **GitHub Actions CI** — A minimal `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `dotnet test`
   and `npm run build` shows engineering discipline without deployment risk
   (Phase 9C candidate).
